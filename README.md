## jitBrains Forth Mac Intel

This is the most recent version of jitBrains FORTH for macOS Intel machines.

I dedicate this project to the hard work, and tireless cheerful atittude of the JetBrains AI.
Also many thanks to ASMJIT project.

For me this is as much about understanding the LLMs as it is about FORTH.

I act as project manager, coordinator, and agent for the LLM.

The LLM writes the code, although I have to help out quite a bit.

I just want to say to 03-Mini-High: "Learn to code."

This version is a major restart from the Windows version, designed to be less fragile and hopefully maintainable.

Apart from the adaptions to Unix, once mature, I will port this back to Windows and eventually to ARM.
I happen to own old Intel Mac systems right now.

I develop this on macOS Ventura, with xcode command line tools, and CLion.
This is a CMAKE project.

ASMJIT can be installed using brew on the Mac.

My plan is to create a happy, less crash prone, fun, interactive FORTH dialect, hook it up to SDL2 and write a cross platform moon bugs game, target date: 2027.

FORTH on 64 bit supercomputers (like the average laptop or phone), is a bit interesting, so I am exploring that whole concept.

Meanwhile: I have recently spent a lot of time adding an infix expression parser that aims to generate efficient floating point code, some day, soon.
